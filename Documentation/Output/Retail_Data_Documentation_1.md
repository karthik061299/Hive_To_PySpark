# Retail Data Processing Documentation

## 1. Overview of Job

This Hive job implements a comprehensive retail database management system that supports customer order processing and sales analytics. The workflow creates a complete data infrastructure for retail operations, including customer management, order tracking, and sales analysis with regional partitioning.

The job aligns with enterprise data processing practices by implementing:
- Database schema design with proper table structures
- Data partitioning strategies for performance optimization
- Bucketing for efficient data distribution
- Dynamic partitioning for automated data organization
- Custom UDF integration for specialized transformations
- View creation for reusable business logic
- Proper cleanup and resource management

The business process automated includes customer relationship management, order processing, sales tracking, and regional sales analysis. This supports retail analytics, customer segmentation, and business intelligence reporting.

Key components include:
- External tables: customers, orders, transactions
- Managed tables: sales (partitioned by region)
- Intermediate stages: dynamic partition insertion
- Joins: customer-order relationships
- Aggregations: sales summaries by region, customer order counts
- Filters: regional classification logic
- UDF usage: custom string reversal function
- Views: frequent_customers for reusable customer analysis

## 2. Job Structure and Design

The Hive script follows a structured approach with the following major logical steps:

1. **Database Creation**: Establishes retail_db database namespace
2. **Table Creation**: Creates core tables (customers, orders, sales, transactions)
3. **Data Relationships**: Implements joins between customers and orders
4. **Partitioning Setup**: Configures regional partitions for sales table
5. **Bucketing Implementation**: Sets up customer-based bucketing for transactions
6. **Dynamic Data Loading**: Enables dynamic partitioning and loads sales data
7. **Analytics Processing**: Performs regional sales analysis
8. **Custom Functions**: Implements and uses UDF for string operations
9. **View Creation**: Creates reusable view for frequent customer analysis
10. **Resource Cleanup**: Drops all created objects for clean environment

Reusable components:
- frequent_customers view for customer analysis
- Dynamic partitioning configuration
- Custom UDF for string operations

Patterns implemented:
- Partitioning by region for performance
- Bucketing for data distribution
- Conditional logic for regional classification
- Aggregation patterns for business metrics

Dependencies:
- Hadoop file system for data storage
- Custom UDF class: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDFReverse
- Hive dynamic partitioning settings

## 3. Data Flow and Processing Logic

The data flows from source tables through transformations to analytical outputs:

**Source datasets**: customers, orders, transactions (TEXTFILE format)
**Target datasets**: sales (partitioned), frequent_customers view
**Storage locations**: retail_db database namespace

## 4. Data Mapping

| Target Table Name | Target Column Name | Source Table/Step Name | Source Column Name | Transformation Rule / Business Logic |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| customers | customer_id | Input Data | customer_id | Direct mapping |
| customers | customer_name | Input Data | customer_name | Direct mapping |
| customers | customer_email | Input Data | customer_email | Direct mapping |
| customers | customer_city | Input Data | customer_city | Direct mapping |
| customers | customer_state | Input Data | customer_state | Direct mapping |
| customers | customer_zipcode | Input Data | customer_zipcode | Direct mapping |
| orders | order_id | Input Data | order_id | Direct mapping |
| orders | order_date | Input Data | order_date | Direct mapping |
| orders | customer_id | Input Data | customer_id | Direct mapping |
| orders | order_status | Input Data | order_status | Direct mapping |
| sales | sale_id | transactions | transaction_id | Direct mapping with alias |
| sales | sale_amount | transactions | amount | Direct mapping with alias |
| sales | sale_date | transactions | transaction_date | Direct mapping with alias |
| sales | region | transactions | customer_id | CASE WHEN customer_id IN (1,2) THEN 'north_america' ELSE 'europe' |
| frequent_customers | customer_name | customers | customer_name | Direct mapping |
| frequent_customers | total_orders | orders | order_id | COUNT aggregation with HAVING > 1 |
