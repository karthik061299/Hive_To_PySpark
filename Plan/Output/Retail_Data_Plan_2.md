Description:   Hive to PySpark Migration Plan for Retail Database Management System
=============================================

# Hive to PySpark Migration Plan - Retail Data Processing

## 1. Development and Testing Effort Estimation

### 1.1 Manual Code Refactoring Effort (in hours)

* **Transformers / complex derivations:** 16 hours
  - Database and table creation logic conversion (4 hours)
  - Regional classification CASE WHEN logic (3 hours)
  - Data type mapping and schema definition (4 hours)
  - Storage format conversion from TEXTFILE to DataFrame operations (5 hours)

* **Joins / Aggregations / Window functions:** 12 hours
  - Customer-order INNER JOIN conversion to PySpark DataFrame joins (4 hours)
  - Regional sales aggregation with GROUP BY conversion (3 hours)
  - Frequent customers view with COUNT aggregation and HAVING clause (5 hours)

* **Lateral views / explode / nested structs:** 0 hours
  - No lateral views or explode operations in the current Hive script

* **UDF/UDAF (authoring & validation):** 8 hours
  - Custom UDF replacement for GenericUDFReverse with PySpark UDF (4 hours)
  - UDF registration and testing in PySpark environment (4 hours)

* **Control/conditional flows (branching, sequencing):** 10 hours
  - Dynamic partitioning logic conversion (4 hours)
  - Conditional region assignment logic (3 hours)
  - Error handling and validation logic implementation (3 hours)

* **Helpers/utilities/metadata tracking:** 14 hours
  - Partitioning strategy implementation with partitionBy() (5 hours)
  - Bucketing implementation with bucketBy() method (4 hours)
  - Catalog operations for database and view management (3 hours)
  - Resource cleanup and table management utilities (2 hours)

**Subtotal (Refactoring): 60 hours**

### 1.2 Unit & Reconciliation Testing Effort (in hours)

* **Test data design & generation:** 12 hours
  - Create sample datasets for customers, orders, transactions tables (4 hours)
  - Generate edge cases for regional classification testing (3 hours)
  - Create test scenarios for partitioning and bucketing validation (5 hours)

* **Row/column checks & rule assertions:** 16 hours
  - Data quality validation between Hive and PySpark outputs (6 hours)
  - Schema validation and data type consistency checks (4 hours)
  - Business rule validation for regional sales classification (3 hours)
  - Join result validation and record count reconciliation (3 hours)

* **Partition boundary & volume tests:** 10 hours
  - Regional partition validation (north_america vs europe) (4 hours)
  - Bucketing distribution validation across 4 buckets (3 hours)
  - Volume testing with large datasets (3 hours)

* **Performance sanity tests:** 8 hours
  - Query performance comparison between Hive and PySpark (4 hours)
  - Resource utilization and optimization validation (2 hours)
  - Caching strategy effectiveness testing (2 hours)

**Subtotal (Testing): 46 hours**

**Total Estimated Effort (hours) = 60 + 46 = 106 hours**

## 2. Compute Resource Cost

### 2.1 Spark Runtime Cost (with calculation details and assumptions)

* **Assumptions**
  * Platform: Azure Databricks
  * Cluster: Standard job cluster with 1 driver + 3 worker nodes (Standard_DS3_v2)
  * Average runtime per execution: 45 minutes
  * Runs per day: 2 (morning and evening batch processing)
  * Runs per week: 14
  * Runs per month: 60
  * Input data volume per run: 5.5 TB (Retail_Sales_Data ~50 TB processed in chunks, Sales and Transactions ~5 TB)
  * Pricing reference: $0.22 per DBU/hour + $0.60 per hour per node compute cost
  * DBU consumption: 4 nodes × 2 DBUs per node = 8 DBUs per hour

* **Calculation**
  * DBU cost per run: 8 DBUs × 0.75 hours × $0.22 = $1.32
  * Compute cost per run: 4 nodes × 0.75 hours × $0.60 = $1.80
  * Per-run cost: $1.32 + $1.80 = $3.12
  * Daily cost: $3.12 × 2 runs = $6.24
  * Monthly cost: $3.12 × 60 runs = $187.20
  * Storage cost (monthly): 5.5 TB × $18.40 per TB = $101.20
  * **Total Monthly Cost: $187.20 + $101.20 = $288.40**

* **Notes**
  * Tuning levers available:
    - Caching intermediate DataFrames for customer-order joins
    - Partitioning optimization using repartition() before writes
    - Broadcast joins for smaller lookup tables
    - Column pruning and predicate pushdown
    - Delta Lake adoption for better performance and ACID compliance
    - Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) for dynamic optimization
  * Cost risks:
    - Data skew in regional partitions could cause uneven processing
    - Large shuffles during bucketing operations
    - Memory spills if insufficient cluster resources
    - Inefficient file sizes without proper coalescing
  * Optimization potential: 20-30% cost reduction through proper caching, partitioning, and Delta Lake implementation

## 3. Migration Strategy and Risk Assessment

### 3.1 High-Risk Areas
* **Custom UDF Migration:** GenericUDFReverse replacement requires careful testing
* **Dynamic Partitioning:** Hive's dynamic partitioning behavior needs exact replication
* **Bucketing Strategy:** Customer-based bucketing must maintain data distribution
* **Performance Parity:** Ensuring PySpark performance matches or exceeds Hive

### 3.2 Recommended Approach
* **Phase 1:** Core table creation and basic transformations (20 hours)
* **Phase 2:** Join operations and aggregations (15 hours)
* **Phase 3:** Partitioning and bucketing implementation (15 hours)
* **Phase 4:** UDF migration and custom functions (10 hours)
* **Phase 5:** Testing and validation (46 hours)

### 3.3 Success Criteria
* 100% data accuracy between Hive and PySpark outputs
* Performance improvement of at least 15% over current Hive implementation
* Successful handling of 5.5 TB data volume
* All 4 tables (customers, orders, sales, transactions) migrated successfully
* Regional partitioning and bucketing working as expected
