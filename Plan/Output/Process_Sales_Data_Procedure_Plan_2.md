# Hive to PySpark Migration Plan
## Process_Sales_Data_Procedure

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Databricks Runtime Cost

**Environment Assumptions:**
- Cluster Type: Standard_DS3_v2 (4 cores, 14 GB RAM)
- DBU Rate: $0.15 per DBU/hour
- DBUs per Node: 1 DBU/hour
- Number of Nodes: 3 (1 driver + 2 workers)
- Estimated Runtime: 2 hours per execution
- Monthly Executions: 30 (daily execution)

**Cost Calculation Breakdown:**

**Per Execution Cost:**
- Total DBUs per hour: 3 nodes × 1 DBU = 3 DBUs/hour
- Runtime per execution: 2 hours
- DBU cost per execution: 3 DBUs × 2 hours × $0.15 = $0.90
- VM cost per execution: 3 nodes × 2 hours × $0.096/hour = $0.576
- **Total cost per execution: $1.476**

**Monthly Cost:**
- Monthly executions: 30
- **Total monthly cost: $1.476 × 30 = $44.28**

**Annual Cost:**
- **Total annual cost: $44.28 × 12 = $531.36**

**Cost Reasoning:**
- The procedure processes sales data with aggregations and temporary table operations
- Cursor-based processing in original Hive will be converted to DataFrame operations, improving efficiency
- Data volume estimated at medium scale (millions of records) based on sales transaction nature
- Spark's distributed processing will handle the workload more efficiently than row-by-row cursor operations
- Cost includes both compute (DBU) and infrastructure (VM) components

## 2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 PySpark Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort

**High-Complexity Manual Interventions Required:**

**1. Stored Procedure Architecture Conversion (40 hours)**
- Convert CREATE PROCEDURE to Python function definition
- Replace parameter handling (IN start_date, end_date) with function arguments
- Restructure procedural logic to functional PySpark approach
- **Reason:** Complete paradigm shift from SQL stored procedures to Python functions

**2. Dynamic SQL Elimination (32 hours)**
- Replace CONCAT and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with programmatic DataFrame operations
- Convert dynamic INSERT statements to DataFrame write operations
- Implement parameterized filtering using DataFrame API
- **Reason:** PySpark doesn't support dynamic SQL execution; requires DataFrame API approach

**3. Cursor Operations Replacement (48 hours)**
- Replace DECLARE CURSOR with DataFrame collect() or foreach() operations
- Convert FETCH cursor_name INTO variable to DataFrame row iteration
- Eliminate WHILE loop cursor processing with DataFrame transformations
- **Reason:** Cursors don't exist in PySpark; row-by-row processing needs complete redesign

**4. Temporary Table Management (24 hours)**
- Replace CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE with DataFrame caching/persistence
- Convert temp_sales_summary to cached DataFrame
- Implement proper DataFrame lifecycle management
- **Reason:** Different temporary data handling mechanisms between Hive and Spark

**5. Control Flow Logic Conversion (16 hours)**
- Convert WHILE loops to DataFrame operations or Python iterations
- Replace procedural variable assignments with functional transformations
- Implement error handling for DataFrame operations
- **Reason:** Different control flow patterns between SQL procedures and PySpark

**6. Data Aggregation Optimization (20 hours)**
- Convert SUM(sales) GROUP BY product_id to DataFrame.groupBy().agg()
- Implement proper partitioning strategies for performance
- Add column pruning and predicate pushdown optimizations
- **Reason:** Need to optimize for Spark's distributed computing model

**Unit Testing Effort (60 hours):**
- **Data Validation Tests (20 hours):** Verify aggregation accuracy between Hive and PySpark outputs
- **Parameter Testing (15 hours):** Test date range filtering with various input scenarios
- **Performance Testing (15 hours):** Validate execution time and resource utilization
- **Edge Case Testing (10 hours):** Handle null values, empty datasets, invalid date ranges

**Reconciliation Testing Effort (40 hours):**
- **Data Reconciliation (25 hours):** Compare row counts, sum totals, and data integrity between original Hive and converted PySpark outputs
- **Business Logic Validation (15 hours):** Ensure business rules are maintained in the conversion

**Integration Testing (24 hours):**
- **End-to-End Testing (16 hours):** Test complete pipeline from source to target tables
- **Dependency Testing (8 hours):** Validate interactions with upstream and downstream systems

**Total Effort Summary:**
- **Manual Code Fixes: 180 hours**
- **Unit Testing: 60 hours**
- **Reconciliation Testing: 40 hours**
- **Integration Testing: 24 hours**
- **Total Development Effort: 304 hours**

**Effort Distribution by Tables:**
- **sales_table (source):** 40 hours - Data reading, filtering, and validation
- **summary_table (target):** 60 hours - Aggregation logic and direct insert conversion
- **detailed_sales_summary (target):** 80 hours - Cursor processing replacement and complex logic
- **temp_sales_summary (temporary):** 50 hours - Temporary table to DataFrame caching conversion
- **Overall integration and testing:** 74 hours

**Risk Factors:**
- High complexity score (85/100) indicates significant manual intervention required
- Stored procedure features have no direct PySpark equivalents
- Cursor-based processing requires architectural changes
- Dynamic SQL conversion needs careful testing to ensure equivalent functionality

**Recommended Approach:**
- **Rebuild Strategy:** Complete redesign using PySpark best practices (recommended)
- **Timeline:** 8-10 weeks with 1 senior PySpark developer
- **Validation:** Parallel run comparison for 2-4 weeks to ensure data accuracy
