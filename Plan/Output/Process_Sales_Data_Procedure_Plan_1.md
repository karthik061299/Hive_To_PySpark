# Hive to PySpark Migration Plan
## Process_Sales_Data_Procedure

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Databricks Runtime Cost

**Environment Assumptions:**
- Cluster Type: Standard_DS3_v2 (4 cores, 14 GB RAM)
- DBU Rate: $0.15 per DBU/hour
- DBUs per hour: 3 DBUs/hour per node
- Node Count: 3 nodes (1 driver + 2 workers)
- Estimated Runtime: 2 hours per execution
- Monthly Executions: 30 runs

**Cost Calculation Breakdown:**

**Per Execution Cost:**
- Total DBUs per hour = 3 nodes × 3 DBUs = 9 DBUs/hour
- Runtime cost per execution = 9 DBUs × 2 hours × $0.15 = $2.70
- Azure VM cost per hour = 3 nodes × $0.188/hour = $0.564/hour
- VM cost per execution = $0.564 × 2 hours = $1.128
- **Total cost per execution = $2.70 + $1.128 = $3.828**

**Monthly Cost:**
- Monthly runtime cost = $3.828 × 30 executions = **$114.84**

**Cost Reasoning:**
- The procedure processes sales data with aggregations and temporary table operations
- Cursor-based processing in original Hive will be converted to DataFrame operations, improving efficiency
- Data volume estimated at medium scale (millions of records) based on sales transaction nature
- Temporary table creation and cursor iterations require additional compute resources
- Date range filtering and GROUP BY operations on product_id will benefit from Spark's distributed processing

## 2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 PySpark Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort

**High-Complexity Manual Fixes Required:**

**1. Stored Procedure Architecture Conversion (40 hours)**
- Convert CREATE PROCEDURE to Python function definition
- Replace parameter handling (IN start_date, end_date) with function arguments
- Restructure procedural logic to functional DataFrame operations
- **Reason:** Complete paradigm shift from procedural to functional programming

**2. Dynamic SQL Elimination (32 hours)**
- Replace CONCAT and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with programmatic DataFrame operations
- Convert dynamic INSERT statements to DataFrame.write operations
- Implement parameterized filtering using DataFrame.filter() with variables
- **Reason:** Dynamic SQL has no direct equivalent in PySpark DataFrame API

**3. Cursor Operations Replacement (36 hours)**
- Replace DECLARE CURSOR with DataFrame.collect() or iterative processing
- Convert FETCH operations to DataFrame row iteration
- Eliminate WHILE loop with cursor-based processing
- Implement row-by-row logic using DataFrame.foreach() or collect() patterns
- **Reason:** Cursors don't exist in PySpark; requires distributed processing approach

**4. Temporary Table Management (16 hours)**
- Replace CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE with DataFrame.cache() or .persist()
- Convert temp_sales_summary to cached DataFrame
- Implement proper DataFrame lifecycle management
- **Reason:** Different temporary storage mechanisms between Hive and Spark

**5. Control Flow Logic Conversion (12 hours)**
- Convert WHILE loop to Python for/while loops with DataFrame operations
- Replace NULL checking logic with DataFrame null handling
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- **Reason:** Different control flow syntax and DataFrame-based processing

**6. Aggregation and Data Processing (20 hours)**
- Convert SUM() with GROUP BY to DataFrame.groupBy().agg() operations
- Implement date filtering using DataFrame.filter() with BETWEEN equivalent
- Optimize aggregation operations for distributed processing
- Handle multiple target table insertions (summary_table, detailed_sales_summary)
- **Reason:** Different aggregation syntax and optimization requirements

**Unit Testing Effort (48 hours)**
- Create unit tests for each converted function component
- Test parameter validation and edge cases
- Validate aggregation logic against original Hive results
- Test temporary DataFrame caching and persistence
- Performance testing for different data volumes
- Integration testing with source and target tables

**Data Reconciliation Testing (40 hours)**
- Compare output between original Hive procedure and converted PySpark code
- Validate row counts and aggregation results for temp_sales_summary
- Test date range filtering accuracy
- Verify product_id grouping and SUM calculations
- End-to-end testing with various date ranges and data volumes
- Performance benchmarking and optimization validation

**Total Effort Summary:**
- **Manual Code Fixes: 156 hours**
- **Unit Testing: 48 hours**
- **Data Reconciliation Testing: 40 hours**
- **Total Effort: 244 hours (approximately 6-7 weeks)**

**Effort Justification:**
- High complexity score (85/100) due to stored procedure architecture
- Multiple Hive-specific features requiring complete rewriting
- Cursor-based processing needs fundamental approach change
- Dynamic SQL requires programmatic DataFrame operations
- Comprehensive testing needed due to architectural changes
- Performance optimization required for distributed processing
