# Hive to PySpark Migration Plan
## Process_Sales_Data_Procedure.txt

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Databricks Runtime Cost

**Cluster Configuration:**
- Cluster Type: Standard Job Cluster
- Node Type: Standard_DS3_v2 (4 cores, 14 GB RAM)
- Driver Node: 1 x Standard_DS3_v2
- Worker Nodes: 8 x Standard_DS3_v2
- DBU Rate: $0.22 per DBU/hour
- DBUs per Node: 1 DBU per node
- Total DBUs: 9 DBUs (1 driver + 8 workers)

**Cost Calculation Breakdown:**

**Compute Cost:**
- Total DBUs: 9 DBUs
- DBU Rate: $0.22 per DBU/hour
- Estimated Runtime: 4 hours for full data processing
- Compute Cost = 9 DBUs × $0.22/hour × 4 hours = **$7.92**

**Storage Cost (Monthly):**
- Data Volume: 10 TB (sales_table)
- Storage Rate: $18.40 per TB/month
- Storage Cost = 10 TB × $18.40/TB = **$184.00/month**

**Total Estimated Cost per Run: $7.92**
**Monthly Storage Cost: $184.00**

**Reasons for Cost Estimation:**
- The procedure processes 10 TB of sales data requiring significant compute resources
- Complex aggregations and cursor-based processing increase runtime requirements
- Multiple table operations (summary_table, detailed_sales_summary, temp_sales_summary) require sustained cluster usage
- Dynamic SQL execution and temporary table creation add computational overhead
- Data shuffling for GROUP BY operations across 8 worker nodes increases network and compute costs

## 2. Code Fixing and Reconciliation Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 PySpark Manual Code Fixes and Reconciliation Testing Effort

**Manual Code Fixes Required:**

**1. Stored Procedure Conversion (16 hours)**
- Convert Hive stored procedure to PySpark function structure
- Redesign parameter passing mechanism from IN parameters to function arguments
- Implement proper error handling and logging for PySpark environment
- **Reason:** Complete architectural change from procedural to functional programming model

**2. Dynamic SQL Elimination (12 hours)**
- Replace CONCAT and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with parameterized DataFrame operations
- Implement safe parameter substitution using PySpark DataFrame filters
- Restructure query logic to use DataFrame API instead of dynamic SQL strings
- **Reason:** PySpark doesn't support dynamic SQL execution; requires fundamental approach change

**3. Cursor-Based Processing Refactor (20 hours)**
- Replace cursor operations with DataFrame collect() and Python iteration
- Implement efficient batch processing instead of row-by-row cursor iteration
- Optimize data collection and processing patterns for distributed computing
- **Reason:** Cursors don't exist in PySpark; requires paradigm shift to DataFrame operations

**4. Temporary Table Management (8 hours)**
- Convert Hive temporary tables to PySpark temporary views or DataFrame caching
- Implement proper resource management and cleanup for temporary objects
- Optimize memory usage with appropriate caching strategies
- **Reason:** Different temporary object lifecycle management between Hive and PySpark

**5. Variable Declaration and Scoping (6 hours)**
- Convert DECLARE statements to Python variable assignments
- Implement proper variable scoping within PySpark functions
- Handle data type conversions between Hive and PySpark
- **Reason:** Different variable declaration and scoping mechanisms

**6. Aggregation Logic Optimization (10 hours)**
- Optimize GROUP BY operations for distributed processing
- Implement efficient partitioning strategies for large dataset aggregations
- Add column pruning and predicate pushdown optimizations
- **Reason:** Need to leverage Catalyst optimizer and distributed computing benefits

**Total Manual Code Fixing Effort: 72 hours**

**Reconciliation Testing Effort:**

**1. Data Validation Testing (24 hours)**
- Compare aggregated results between Hive and PySpark implementations
- Validate SUM calculations across all product_id groups
- Test date range filtering accuracy and completeness
- Verify row counts and data integrity across all target tables

**2. Performance Testing (16 hours)**
- Benchmark runtime performance between original Hive and new PySpark implementation
- Test scalability with different data volumes and cluster configurations
- Validate memory usage and resource consumption patterns
- Optimize performance bottlenecks identified during testing

**3. Edge Case Testing (12 hours)**
- Test with empty date ranges and null data scenarios
- Validate behavior with duplicate records and data quality issues
- Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Verify proper cleanup of temporary objects and resources

**4. Integration Testing (8 hours)**
- Test integration with upstream and downstream systems
- Validate data pipeline dependencies and scheduling
- Test parameter passing and configuration management
- Verify logging and monitoring integration

**Total Reconciliation Testing Effort: 60 hours**

**Summary:**
- **Manual Code Fixing:** 72 hours
- **Reconciliation Testing:** 60 hours
- **Total Effort:** 132 hours

**Key Risk Factors:**
- High complexity score (78/100) indicates significant manual intervention required
- Stored procedure pattern requires complete architectural redesign
- Dynamic SQL and cursor operations need fundamental approach changes
- Large data volume (10 TB) requires careful performance optimization and testing
- Multiple temporary table dependencies require careful orchestration in PySpark
