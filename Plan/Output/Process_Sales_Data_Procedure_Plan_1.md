# Hive to PySpark Migration Plan
## Process_Sales_Data_Procedure.txt

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Databricks Runtime Cost

**Cluster Configuration:**
- Cluster Type: Standard Job Cluster
- Node Type: Standard_DS3_v2 (4 cores, 14 GB RAM)
- Number of nodes: 8 nodes (1 driver + 7 workers)
- DBU per node per hour: 1 DBU
- DBU cost: $0.22 per DBU/hour
- Estimated runtime: 4 hours for complete processing
- Data volume: 10 TB processed
- Storage cost: $18.40 per TB/month

**Cost Calculation Breakdown:**

**Compute Cost:**
- Total DBUs per hour: 8 nodes × 1 DBU/node = 8 DBUs/hour
- Total runtime: 4 hours
- Total DBU consumption: 8 DBUs/hour × 4 hours = 32 DBUs
- Compute cost: 32 DBUs × $0.22/DBU = $7.04

**Storage Cost (Monthly):**
- Data volume processed: 10 TB
- Storage cost: 10 TB × $18.40/TB/month = $184.00/month
- Daily storage cost: $184.00/30 = $6.13/day
- Processing day storage cost: $6.13

**Total Estimated Cost per Run:**
- Compute cost: $7.04
- Storage cost (daily): $6.13
- **Total cost per execution: $13.17**

**Reasoning:**
The cost calculation is based on the complex nature of the stored procedure which involves:
- Dynamic SQL generation requiring additional processing overhead
- Cursor-based operations that will be converted to iterative DataFrame operations
- Multiple table operations (source, temporary, and target tables)
- Aggregation operations on 10TB of sales data
- The 4-hour runtime estimate accounts for the complexity of converting cursor operations to distributed DataFrame processing

## 2. Code Fixing and Reconciliation Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 PySpark Manual Code Fixes and Reconciliation Testing Effort

**Development Effort Breakdown:**

**1. Stored Procedure to Python Function Conversion: 16 hours**
- Convert CREATE PROCEDURE syntax to Python function definition
- Implement parameter handling for start_date and end_date
- Set up proper function structure and return mechanisms
- Complexity: High due to paradigm shift from SQL procedure to Python function

**2. Dynamic SQL Elimination and DataFrame Operations: 24 hours**
- Replace CONCAT and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with parameterized DataFrame operations
- Convert dynamic query construction to static DataFrame transformations
- Implement proper parameter binding for date filtering
- Complexity: Very High due to fundamental approach change

**3. Cursor Operations Replacement: 32 hours**
- Convert DECLARE CURSOR, OPEN, FETCH, CLOSE operations to DataFrame collect() and iteration
- Implement row-by-row processing using PySpark DataFrame operations
- Optimize cursor-based logic to leverage PySpark's distributed processing
- Handle NULL checking and loop termination conditions
- Complexity: Very High due to complete processing model change

**4. Variable and Parameter Management: 8 hours**
- Convert DECLARE and SET statements to Python variables
- Implement proper variable scoping and lifecycle management
- Handle parameter passing and validation
- Complexity: Medium due to syntax differences

**5. Temporary Table Management: 12 hours**
- Convert CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE to createOrReplaceTempView()
- Implement proper temporary view lifecycle management
- Ensure proper cleanup and resource management
- Complexity: Medium due to different lifecycle patterns

**6. Error Handling and Logging Implementation: 16 hours**
- Add comprehensive error handling mechanisms
- Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- Add data validation and quality checks
- Complexity: Medium but essential for production readiness

**7. Performance Optimization: 20 hours**
- Implement caching strategies for intermediate DataFrames
- Add column pruning and predicate pushdown optimizations
- Configure proper partitioning and bucketing strategies
- Optimize aggregation operations for large datasets
- Complexity: High due to performance requirements on 10TB data

**Total Development Effort: 128 hours**

**Reconciliation Testing Effort Breakdown:**

**1. Unit Testing: 32 hours**
- Create comprehensive unit tests for each converted function
- Test parameter validation and edge cases
- Validate DataFrame transformations and aggregations
- Test error handling scenarios

**2. Data Reconciliation Testing: 48 hours**
- Compare output between original Hive procedure and PySpark implementation
- Validate aggregation accuracy across different date ranges
- Test with various data volumes and edge cases
- Perform row-by-row comparison for critical business logic
- Validate temporary table data consistency

**3. Performance Testing: 24 hours**
- Benchmark PySpark implementation against Hive procedure
- Test scalability with 10TB dataset
- Validate memory usage and cluster resource utilization
- Optimize performance based on test results

**4. Integration Testing: 16 hours**
- Test integration with upstream and downstream systems
- Validate end-to-end data pipeline functionality
- Test scheduling and orchestration integration
- Validate monitoring and alerting mechanisms

**Total Testing Effort: 120 hours**

**Summary:**
- **Total Development Effort: 128 hours**
- **Total Testing Effort: 120 hours**
- **Combined Total Effort: 248 hours**

**Effort Justification:**
The high effort estimate is justified due to:
- **Complexity Score of 78/100**: Indicating high complexity conversion
- **Complete Paradigm Shift**: From procedural SQL to functional DataFrame operations
- **Dynamic SQL Complexity**: Requiring significant restructuring
- **Cursor Operations**: Need complete rewrite using distributed processing patterns
- **Large Data Volume**: 10TB processing requires careful optimization and testing
- **Business Critical Nature**: Sales data processing requires thorough validation

**Risk Factors:**
- Cursor-based logic may require multiple iterations to optimize for PySpark
- Dynamic SQL patterns may reveal hidden business logic during conversion
- Performance optimization may require additional tuning cycles
- Data reconciliation complexity increases with 10TB volume
