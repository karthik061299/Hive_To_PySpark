# Hive to PySpark Migration Plan
## Process_Sales_Data_Procedure

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Databricks Runtime Cost

**Environment Assumptions:**
- Cluster Type: Standard_DS3_v2 (4 cores, 14 GB RAM)
- DBU Rate: $0.15 per DBU/hour
- DBUs per hour: 3 DBUs
- Runtime Duration: 2 hours (estimated for development and testing)
- Number of execution runs: 10 runs (for testing and validation)

**Cost Calculation Breakdown:**
- Base compute cost per hour: 3 DBUs × $0.15 = $0.45/hour
- Development runtime: 2 hours × $0.45 = $0.90
- Testing runs: 10 runs × 0.5 hours × $0.45 = $2.25
- **Total Databricks Runtime Cost: $3.15**

**Reasoning:**
- The procedure processes sales data with aggregations and temporary table operations
- Estimated moderate data volume requiring standard cluster configuration
- Multiple test runs needed due to complex cursor-to-DataFrame conversion
- Additional overhead for performance optimization and validation

## 2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 PySpark Manual Code Fixes and Unit Testing Effort

**Manual Code Fixes Required (32 hours total):**

**A. Stored Procedure to Python Function Conversion (8 hours)**
- Convert CREATE PROCEDURE syntax to Python function definition
- Implement parameter handling for start_date and end_date
- Set up proper function structure and return mechanisms
- **Reason:** Complete paradigm shift from SQL procedure to Python function

**B. Dynamic SQL and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE Replacement (10 hours)**
- Replace CONCAT-based dynamic query construction with parameterized DataFrame operations
- Convert EXECUTE IMMEDIATE to direct PySpark DataFrame transformations
- Implement proper SQL injection prevention in parameterized queries
- **Reason:** Dynamic SQL generation requires significant restructuring for PySpark

**C. Cursor Operations to DataFrame Processing (12 hours)**
- Replace DECLARE CURSOR, OPEN, FETCH, CLOSE with DataFrame collect() operations
- Convert WHILE loop with cursor to Python iteration over DataFrame rows
- Implement row-by-row processing using DataFrame.collect() and foreach operations
- Optimize cursor-based logic to leverage PySpark's batch processing capabilities
- **Reason:** Most complex conversion due to fundamental difference in processing paradigms

**D. Temporary Table Management (2 hours)**
- Convert CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE to createOrReplaceTempView()
- Update table lifecycle management for PySpark temporary views
- Ensure proper cleanup of temporary views
- **Reason:** Different syntax and lifecycle management in PySpark

**Unit Testing Effort (18 hours total):**

**A. Data Validation Testing (8 hours)**
- Test summary_table aggregation accuracy against original Hive results
- Validate detailed_sales_summary row-by-row processing correctness
- Test temp_sales_summary intermediate results
- Verify date range filtering functionality

**B. Edge Case Testing (6 hours)**
- Test with empty date ranges
- Test with null values in sales data
- Test with boundary date conditions
- Test with large data volumes

**C. Performance Testing (4 hours)**
- Compare execution times between cursor-based and DataFrame-based approaches
- Validate memory usage and optimization effectiveness
- Test scalability with varying data volumes

**Reconciliation Testing Effort (12 hours total):**

**A. Data Reconciliation (8 hours)**
- Row count validation between Hive and PySpark outputs
- Sum validation for total_sales aggregations
- Product_id completeness verification
- End-to-end data lineage validation

**B. Business Logic Validation (4 hours)**
- Verify sales aggregation business rules
- Validate date filtering logic accuracy
- Confirm temporary table processing consistency

**Total Effort Summary:**
- **Manual Code Fixes: 32 hours**
- **Unit Testing: 18 hours**
- **Reconciliation Testing: 12 hours**
- **Total Development and Testing Effort: 62 hours**

**Key Risk Areas:**
- Cursor-to-DataFrame conversion complexity may require additional debugging time
- Dynamic SQL replacement might need iterative refinement
- Performance optimization may require additional tuning effort
- Data volume scaling tests may reveal additional optimization needs

**Assumptions:**
- Developer has intermediate PySpark experience
- Test data is available and representative of production volumes
- Databricks environment is properly configured
- Source sales_table structure is well-documented
