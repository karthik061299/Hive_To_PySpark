### **1. Development and Testing Effort Estimation**

#### **1.1 Manual Code Refactoring Effort (in hours)**
*   Transformers / complex derivations: `6`
*   Joins / Aggregations / Window functions: `4`
*   Lateral views / explode / nested structs: `0`
*   UDF/UDAF (authoring & validation): `3`
*   Control/conditional flows (branching, sequencing): `8`
*   Helpers/utilities/metadata tracking: `5`
*   **Subtotal (Refactoring):** `26`

#### **1.2 Unit & Reconciliation Testing Effort (in hours)**
*   Test data design & generation: `4`
*   Row/column checks & rule assertions: `10`
*   Partition boundary & volume tests: `4`
*   Performance sanity tests: `2`
*   **Subtotal (Testing):** `20`

**Total Estimated Effort (hours) = 26 + 20 = 46**

### **2. Compute Resource Cost **

#### **2.1 Spark Runtime Cost (with calculation details and assumptions)**
*   **Assumptions**
    *   Platform: `Azure Databricks`
    *   Cluster: `10 nodes (1 Driver, 9 Workers), standard general-purpose VMs`
    *   Average runtime per execution: `02:00`
    *   Runs per day / week / month: `1 / 7 / 30`
    *   Input data volume per run: `~5.5 TB`
    *   Pricing reference: `$0.60 per node per hour (blended rate for compute)`
*   **Calculation**

    *   Per-run cost: `10 nodes * 2 hours * $0.60/node-hour = $12.00`
    *   Daily cost: `$12.00`
    *   Monthly cost: `$360.00`
*   **Notes**

    *   Tuning levers (caching, partitioning, AQE, broadcast thresholds): Costs can be optimized by leveraging Spark's native features. The rebuild approach will focus on implementing partitioning correctly, which is the primary performance consideration for this job.
    *   Cost risks (skew, shuffles, spills): The join and aggregation logic are simple and unlikely to cause significant skew or spills with the given data structure. The primary cost driver will be the volume of data read and processed during the dynamic partition insert.
