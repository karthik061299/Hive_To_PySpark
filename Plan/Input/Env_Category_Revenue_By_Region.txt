Azure Databricks pricing is based on Databricks Units (DBUs), compute instance costs, and storage costs. Compute costs vary by VM type, with a standard job cluster costing around $0.22 per DBU/hour, plus storage at $18.40 per TB/month.

Processing Sales and Product Data for ranked category revenue analysis involves:

sales: Transaction data for product orders.

products: Product metadata with category mapping.

regions: Regional details for revenue aggregation.

The estimated data processed includes:

Sales Data: ~15 TB of transactional data.

Product and Region Data: ~2 TB of metadata.

Estimated compute cost is $0.70 per hour per node, depending on cluster size and job duration. Optimizations such as Delta Lake, partitioning, bucketing, window functions, caching, and indexing can significantly reduce costs.
