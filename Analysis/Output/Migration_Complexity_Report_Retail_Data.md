Description:   Migration complexity analysis report for the Hive retail data processing workflow.
=============================================

### 1. Script Overview:
The Hive script is designed for a retail data processing workflow. Its primary business objectives are to structure raw retail data into queryable formats for analysis, specifically to analyze sales performance by region and to identify frequent customers. The script creates and populates tables for customers, orders, sales, and transactions, performs transformations and aggregations, and generates analytical insights before cleaning up the created database objects.

### 2. Complexity Metrics:
*   **Number of Lines:** Approximately 70-90 lines (Estimated based on the described logic: database creation, 4 table definitions, 1 view, 1 UDF, 1 insert, multiple selects, and cleanup).
*   **Tables Used:** 5 (4 tables: `customers`, `orders`, `sales`, `transactions`; 1 view: `frequent_customers`).
*   **Joins:** 1 `INNER JOIN` (between `customers` and `orders` to create the `frequent_customers` view).
*   **Temporary/CTE Tables:** 1 View (`frequent_customers`). No CTEs (`WITH` clauses) are mentioned.
*   **Aggregate Functions:** 2 (`COUNT`, `SUM`).
*   **DML Statements:** 3+ (1 `INSERT` with dynamic partitioning, at least 2 `SELECT` statements for analysis).
*   **Conditional Logic:** 1 (`CASE WHEN` statement used for transformation logic during the dynamic partition insert).

### 3. Syntax Differences:
*   **DDL for Table Creation:** PySpark does not use Hive's DDL syntax. Table creation (`CREATE TABLE`), partitioning (`PARTITIONED BY`), and bucketing (`CLUSTERED BY`) will be handled through DataFrame write operations (`.write.partitionBy().saveAsTable()`).
*   **Dynamic Partitioning:** The Hive-specific `SET` commands (`hive.exec.dynamic.partition`, `hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode`) are not used in PySpark. Dynamic partitioning is a native feature of the DataFrameWriter API.
*   **Temporary UDF:** The `CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION` syntax is specific to Hive. In PySpark, a UDF would be defined in Python and registered with Spark's `udf` registry.
*   **View Creation:** `CREATE VIEW` is SQL-specific. In PySpark, a similar concept can be achieved by creating a temporary view using `df.createOrReplaceTempView()`.
*   **Data Types:** Minor differences in data type names (e.g., `STRING` in Hive vs. `StringType` in PySpark) are handled by Spark's Catalyst optimizer but are a point of attention.

### 4. Manual Adjustments:
*   **Function Replacements:**
    *   The temporary UDF `reverse_string` must be rewritten as a Python function and registered as a PySpark UDF using `pyspark.sql.functions.udf`.
*   **Syntax Adjustments:**
    *   All `CREATE TABLE` statements must be converted to PySpark DataFrame `write` operations. For example, loading the `sales` table would change from `INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales PARTITION(region) ...` to `df.write.partitionBy("region").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("sales")`.
    *   The `CLUSTERED BY` (bucketing) clause on the `transactions` table needs to be implemented using `.bucketBy()` in the DataFrameWriter API.
    *   The `CREATE VIEW` statement for `frequent_customers` should be replaced with `df.createOrReplaceTempView("frequent_customers")`.
*   **Strategies for Rewriting Unsupported Features:**
    *   **Dynamic Partitioning:** The logic needs to be refactored. The `CASE` statement that determines the partition column (`region`) will be part of the DataFrame transformation logic that creates the `region` column before the write operation.
    *   **External Tables:** Reading from external text files will be done using `spark.read.csv('/path/to/customers_data')`. The schema will need to be defined explicitly or inferred.

### 5. Conversion Complexity:
*   **Complexity Score: 65/100**
*   This score is justified due to the moderate level of manual intervention required.
*   **High-complexity areas:**
    *   **Hive-Specific Features:** The script relies on features like dynamic partitioning, bucketing, and temporary UDFs, which have different implementations in PySpark and require careful rewriting.
    *   **Imperative Cleanup:** The final `DROP` statements represent an imperative workflow style. A PySpark job would typically be designed to write final outputs to a persistent location rather than creating and dropping objects within a single script.
    *   **Dependency on External Files:** The logic for reading and schema definition for the external files needs to be explicitly coded in PySpark.

### 6. Optimization Techniques:
*   **Column Pruning and Projection Pushdown:** The conversion to PySpark DataFrames will automatically benefit from this. Ensure only necessary columns are selected early in the process (e.g., in `spark.read` or subsequent `select` transformations).
*   **Using `repartition`/`coalesce`:** When writing the `sales` table, repartitioning by the `region` column (`df.repartition("region")`) before the write operation can optimize write performance by reducing the number of files written per partition.
*   **Caching Intermediate Results:** The DataFrame resulting from the join between `customers` and `orders` could be cached (`.cache()`) if it were to be used multiple times, though in this specific workflow it is used only once.
*   **Recommendation: Rebuild**
    *   **Refactor:** A direct refactor is possible but would result in a PySpark script that mimics the structure of the original Hive script (e.g., creating and dropping temp views). This approach is faster to implement but less idiomatic and may not fully leverage Spark's capabilities.
    *   **Rebuild:** A rebuild is recommended. This involves redesigning the flow to be more functional and modular. The logic would be broken down into distinct functions for data ingestion, transformation, and analysis. This approach leads to more maintainable, testable, and performant code that aligns better with modern data engineering practices. It avoids the imperative "create-then-drop" pattern in favor of producing persistent, well-defined output datasets.
