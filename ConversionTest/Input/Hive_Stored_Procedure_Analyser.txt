### Complexity Metrics:
1. **Number of Lines:**
   - Count of lines in the Hive SQL code: 36

2. **Tables Used:**
   - Number of tables referenced in the Hive SQL code: 4 (`sales_table`, `summary_table`, `detailed_sales_summary`, `temp_sales_summary`)

3. **Joins:**
   - Number of joins and the types of joins used: 0

4. **Temporary Tables:**
   - Number of volatile or derived tables used in the code: 1 (`temp_sales_summary`)

5. **Partitions Used:**
   - Number of partitions involved in queries: 0

6. **Aggregate Functions:**
   - Number of aggregate functions used in the code: 2 (`SUM(sales)`)

7. **DML Statements:**
   - Count of DML statements by type: 
     - SELECT: 2
     - INSERT: 2
     - CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE: 1
     - DROP TABLE: 1

8. **Conditional Logic:**
   - Number of conditional expressions like CASE WHEN, IF, and WHERE filters: 1 (WHERE clause)

### Conversion Complexity:
1. **Complexity Score:**
   - Calculate a complexity score (0â€“100) based on syntax differences, query logic, and the level of manual adjustments required: 45

2. **High-Complexity Areas:**
   - Highlight high-complexity areas such as window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), or Hive-specific clauses: None identified

### Syntax Differences:
1. **Number of Syntax Differences:**
   - Identify the number of syntax differences between the Hive SQL code and the expected PySpark equivalent: Several (e.g., dynamic query construction, cursor usage, temporary table creation)

### Manual Adjustments:
1. **Function Replacements:**
   - Recommend specific manual adjustments for functions and clauses incompatible with PySpark:
     - Replace dynamic query construction with PySpark DataFrame operations
     - Replace cursor usage with DataFrame operations and iteration
     - Use PySpark's `createOrReplaceTempView` for temporary table creation

2. **Syntax Adjustments:**
   - Adjust syntax for DataFrame operations and transformations in PySpark

3. **Strategies for Rewriting Unsupported Features:**
   - Use DataFrame API for aggregations and filtering
   - Use `foreach` or `collect` for row-wise operations instead of cursors

### Optimization Techniques:
1. **Suggest Optimization Strategies for PySpark:**
   - Partitioning: Use DataFrame partitioning for efficient data processing
   - Caching: Cache intermediate DataFrames to speed up repeated operations
   - Bucketing: Use bucketing for efficient joins and aggregations
   - Broadcast Joins: Use broadcast joins for small tables to optimize join operations
   - Query Optimization Techniques: Use Catalyst optimizer for query optimization
